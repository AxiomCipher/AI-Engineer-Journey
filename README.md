# Python Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository contains my solutions from practicing Python basics, organized **week by week**.  
Each week introduces new concepts â€” from printing text to dictionaries and conditionals.

## Covered Topics
### Week 1 (Day 1 - Day 7)
- Day 1: Basic print statements
- Day 2: Variables, f-strings, and string concatenation
- Day 3: Conditionals and user input
- Day 4: Lists and updating values
- Day 5: Loops and list comprehensions
- Day 6: Dictionaries and iteration
- Day 7: Personal Information Manager (dictionary + conditionals)

## File Organization
- `week_1.py` â†’ Contains solutions from **Day 1 to Day 7**
- `week_2.py` â†’ Will contain solutions from **Day 8 to Day 14**
- and so on...

## Next Steps
I will continue adding more weeks as I learn advancedAI-Engineer-Journey
